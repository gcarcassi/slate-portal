On Wednesday, January 15 we plan to have a short outage of central SLATE
services for software updates. The outage is planned for 3 p.m-5 p.m.
CST (17:00-23:00 UTC). During this period the SLATE Web Portal and Command
Line Client access will be unavailable, but services already deployed on edge
clusters will continue to operate without interruption unless unexpected
problems occur.
